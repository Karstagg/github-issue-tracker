# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
-Creating static pages for each github issue

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?
- searching again from the results page

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
- searching again from the results page, a more complex search for that allows for searching by various criteria, authentication feature that allows an admin to make a predefined query for a group's repo
, allowing a static site generator to pre-populate linkable pages at build time for quicker load times.

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
- I chose to build this with gatsby.js because i wanted to make previous searches pre-loaded into graphql on built. It was too much for the timeframe though. I also
opted to use bootstrap(very minimally), standard css, and reactstrap components to speed up the build process. It could have possibly been done better another way,
but I was looking for a quick mvp.

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
-coding: 2 hours
-debugging: 4 hours (some issues with fonts not working - still not working - etc)

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
-Just use standard react, gatsby provided no value.

> Did you learn anything new?
- I definitely learned a lot about trying to get icons and fonts to work with react. I also learned a bit more about how to use .map in react render and
I learned a lot about githubs api.

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
-I think it did. It was certainly a better demonstration of my skills than an online algorithm test or something of that nature.

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
-I am a reasonably competent backend developer, especially with frameworks.
-I'm able to work with both SQL and NoSQL databases
